# TropicalWeatherBot
I spend lots of my free time working on this discord bot but have nothing to show for it, so I am finally putting in on here

### v3: 1st Release
Hopefully everything should be working now, and hopefully I have removed any security holes. We'll see. This is the first version released to GitHub. It contains most of what I have previously worked upon with this bot. Most of these functions were coded months ago so are complete. 

The Veront Temperature model is currently sitting at version 2.5, and will be extensively rewritten over the coming months. I hope to unify versions 2.0 and 2.5 of the Temperature model into version 3.0, so that they read from the same function. The Veront Precipitation Model is only at version 0.5. I need to gather more data before improving it. I also intend to implement a Sunrise/Sunset model, which should be comparatively easy. At some point I would also like to build some temperature controls into the Precipitation Model, to allow for snowfall, but that is currently merely aspirational.

The python version of this bot is sitting at a very early stage in development. Hopefully I will get time to work on transferring more functions across.

Finally, I also intend to implement some kind of 'help' command, as this bot is now so complex that I forget half of the things it does sometimes.
