# TropicalWeatherBot
I spend lots of my free time working on this discord bot but have nothing to show for it, so I am finally putting in on here

### v3: 1st Release
Hopefully everything should be working now, and hopefully I have removed any security holes. We'll see. This is the first version released to GitHub. It contains most of what I have previously worked upon with this bot. Most of these functions were coded months ago so are complete. 

The Veront Temperature model is currently sitting at version 2.5, and will be extensively rewritten over the coming months. I hope to unify versions 2.0 and 2.5 of the Temperature model into version 3.0, so that they read from the same function. The Veront Precipitation Model is only at version 0.5. I need to gather more data before improving it. I also intend to implement a Sunrise/Sunset model, which should be comparatively easy. At some point I would also like to build some temperature controls into the Precipitation Model, to allow for snowfall, but that is currently merely aspirational.

The python version of this bot is sitting at a very early stage in development. Hopefully I will get time to work on transferring more functions across.

Finally, I also intend to implement some kind of 'help' command, as this bot is now so complex that I forget half of the things it does sometimes.

### v7: Happy belated birthday!
This is the second major version of Lucius, with lots of new functionality and lots of older functions removed. Since the last release, the covid functions and some of the 1st gen weather functions have been removed. The hurricane and todo list functions have been rewritten. Extra musical abilities, a tube status function, some more dynamic timer responses, some ASC stuff and a todone list command have been added.

The Veront Temperature model has now reached v3.0, and both the Veather and Xeather functions finally read from this model. The model is much more realistic than before, incorporating north-south and continential-coastal variations, as well as daily fluctuations (which were apparently missing from v2.5). The Veront Precipitation model is now at v2.0. Whilst this does not embody a realistic field, I am very happy with the results this model produces. The only update relative to v1.0 is the incorporation of temperature controls to allow for snowfall. There is as of yet no sunrise/sunset model, but this would require axial tilt/solar declination, as well as a more concrete longitude/latitude system.

I have not touched the python version in months, as Lucius is not suited to development in Python. See <a href="https://github.com/NecessarilyNess/Marina">here</a> for Lucius' sister, written in Python. Likewise, Lucius still lacks a help command. Maybe he can have one for Christmas.

Happy belated birthday Matthew!

### v8: I should probably update this - hello Swack!
Yes I have been working on this, yes I am busy and have other things I should be doing. If you are from Swack, then hello, welcome to this shitshow!
